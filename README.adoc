# Grails Backed Implementation of a Thoughtworks Style Technology Radar

This was created as an exercise to become more familiar with the Grails
http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/introduction.html#webApiAndAngularProfiles[REST API,
AngularJS Profiles] and http://views.grails.org/latest/#_json_views[JSON Views].   Starting
with a fork JavaScript based https://github.com/bdargan/techradar[techradar project]
created by https://github.com/bdargan[bdargan], this project adds a data driven REST service
behind the UI.

## Rough Implementation Steps

* Created a starting application: `./grailsw create-app techradar --profile=angular`

* Created Radar, Quadrant and Item domains: `./grailsw create-domain-resource [name]`

* After filling in their properties, generated all the views and controller implementations:
`./grailsw general-all "*"`

* Generated all the scaffolding based AngularJS CRUD screens for the domains:
`./grailsw ng-generate-all [name] true`

* Folded in the original project's JavaScript libraries into the Grails project structure.

* Replaced static `radarData.js` file with JSON View based REST Service:

** To match the structure of the original static data, a custom JSON view was created
`showData.gson` as well as custom templates for the Quadrant and Item domains.
